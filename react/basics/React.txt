> Why react ?
    
  -  To develop rich internet applications.
    
  -  Much better infastructure and processing capability is now available at client side.
        
        Earlier before 2010, Browser used behave only as Http client and to render html documents, but nowerdays they act like a online virtual OS.
            
            Nowerdays browser offers

                                Data storage:
                                            ~   local storage.
                                            ~   Session storage.
                                            ~   Indexed Database.

                                Multithreading capability:
                                            ~    Web Workers.

                                Device Access:  
                                            ~    Geolocation.

                                Sockets: 
                                            ~    Server Sent Events.
                                            ~    Web Sockets.
- We build an application that runs in the browser that:
        
        ~ handling user interaction.
        ~ view generation.
        ~ state mantained.

Problem: 
    In order to understand how react and other frameworks help us in building the above mentioned application
    We will make a salary calculator

  01_Salary Calculator:
        Salary = basic + hra + da - tax%
  02_Salary Calculator:
        Is a better version of 01_Salary_calculator as it is mantainable.


Mantainable Activities:
    - Fixing Bugs.
    - Adding new features.
    - Removing dead features.
    - Updating old features.

=> An application is easy to mantain if it is easy to change.
  -> For an application to be easy to change there should be a proper segregation of concern.
